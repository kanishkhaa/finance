## 🔴 Problem

Most finance apps assume users earn a predictable monthly salary and spend in standard categories.  
However, many women manage **multiple income sources**, such as:

- Side hustles (home food business, baking, online stores)  
- Freelance or gig work  
- Partner or family contributions  
- Gifts, allowances, and irregular cash flow  

At the same time, their expenses and goals vary across:

- Baby and family needs  
- Personal care (skincare, clothing, wellness)  
- Household responsibilities  
- Savings and investments  
- Long-term goals like travel, home purchase, education, or FIRE  

**Traditional finance apps fail to accommodate this complexity.**  
They don’t support irregular income, custom life-related categories, side-hustle tracking, or future financial simulations.  

This leads to:

- Confusion about where money goes  
- Difficulty saving consistently  
- Poor long-term planning visibility  
- Lower financial confidence  

Women need a tool that adapts to *their* financial realities — not the other way around.
